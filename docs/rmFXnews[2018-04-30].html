<h3>[2018-04-30] Reminderfox Version 2.1.6.2 <small>  <em>Releases for TB 60</em></small></h3>
<p><strong>Release Details</strong></p>
<p>Due to massive changes made by Mozilla for the bases of Firfox and Thunderbird a new release of Reminderfox was necessary.    <br>
Already with Firefox 57 (Quantum) Mozilla rejected addons following their mature, legacy XUL/XPCOM technology. Thunderbird up to version 60 supports that technology, so Reminderfox can be used with that application basis. (Same maybe true for other applications like Waterfox or Seamonkey).</p>
<p><strong>Perspective for the Future of Reminderfox after Mozilla 60</strong></p>
<p>Reminderfox was introduced more than 10 years ago and is based on the mature Mozilla XUL/XPCOM technology. Mozilla is moving to new web technologies. To allow extensions to run in the future it would be necessary to change also to that web technologies. For Reminderfox that's nearly a complete re-write which would be a burden which can't be done in the private time of the authors. So expect Reminderfox will <em>not</em> be continued after Thunderbird 60 and it's a good idea for Reminderfox users to move along to other calendar solutions.    <br>
