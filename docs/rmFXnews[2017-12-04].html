<h3>[2017-12-04] Reminderfox version 2.1.6 <small><em>Pre-Releases for Thunderbird vers.57 and 58</em></small></h3>
<p>The mozilla changes for Add-ons technology has significant impact for Reminderfox also.  </p>
<p>Starting with Firefox 57 (Quantum) 'Legacy' Add-ons are not usable anymore. 
That's the case with Reminderfox as well. As discussed in the 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reminderfox">Reminderfox Forum</a>
users have the possibility to run Reminderfox on some other Firefox devirates or on Thunderbird or Seamonkey.
But also with those alternative platforms Reminderfox requires some code changes. </p>
<p>Reminderfox Pre-Releases are <a href="https://github.com/neandr/reminderfox/releases">available here</a>, 
those versions are tested with Thunderbird 57 and 58 which are available as Nightly builds.</p>
<p><strong>Other Changes with 2.1.6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reminderfox News <br>
This is a new communication channel to the Reminderfox Users, the autors can notify users about important points. <br>
The Reminderfox Main Menu with the right hand Calendar section has added a button [Reminderfox News]. <br>
This button is only shown when News are updated and that is not already read by the user.   <br>
After reading the News that button is disabled. The Reminderfox News can be opened always from the Main Menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync with Remote Calendar <em>Google Calendar</em> <br>
There have been some problems with Reminderfox sync with Google Calendar (GCal). This is solved with vers.2.1.6. <br>
To reactivate a previous used Google Calendar it maybe necessary to remove the calendar entry and re-add it again. <br>
Open Reminderfox Options --&gt; Sync and select [Remove] for the GCal in question, then use [Add] again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
