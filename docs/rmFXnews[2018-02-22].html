<h3>[2018-02-22] Reminderfox version 2.1.6 <small>  <em>Releases for TB 52/58..60 / FX 56</em></small></h3>
<p><strong>Important Notice</strong></p>
<p>The mozilla changes for Add-ons technology has significant impact for Reminderfox also.  </p>
<p>Starting with Firefox 57 (Quantum) 'Legacy' Add-ons are not usable anymore. 
That's the case with Reminderfox as well. As discussed in the 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/reminderfox">Reminderfox Forum</a>
users have the possibility to run Reminderfox on some other Firefox derivatives or on Thunderbird or Seamonkey.  <br>
But also with those alternative platforms Reminderfox required some code changes.</p>
<p><strong>Release Notes for 2.1.6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reminderfox NEWS <br>
This is a new communication channel to the Reminderfox Users, the authors can notify users about important points. <br>
The Reminderfox Main Menu with the right hand Calendar section has added a button [Reminderfox News]. <br>
This button is only shown when News are updated and that is not already read by the user.   <br>
After reading the News that button is disabled. The Reminderfox NEWS can be opened always from the Reminderfox Main Menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync with Remote Calendar <em>Google Calendar</em> <br>
There have been some problems with Reminderfox sync with Google Calendar (GCal). This is solved with vers.2.1.6. <br>
To reactivate a previous used Google Calendar it maybe necessary to remove the calendar entry and re-add it again. <br>
Open Reminderfox Options --&gt; tab:Sync and select [Remove] for the GCal in question, then use [Add] again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Changes<br>
<em>Release version general</em> <br>
  -- Statusbar handling has been changed by Mozilla (partially removed), <br>
     so Reminderfox starting with vers.2.1.6 has removed the Statusbar usage. <br>
     Instead use SmartFoxy (see Options --&gt; tab:Access)<br>
  -- As a fallout from Mozilla changes, the time selector on some dialogs (e.g. Alarms) <br>
     doesn't work anymore; the time value has to be entered individually.
  <em>For Thunderbird</em><br>
  -- SendPlus icon changed <br>
  -- Reminders for Addressbook contact switchable between US/EU format<br>
     (see Options --&gt; tab:Access)   </p>
</li>
</ul>
