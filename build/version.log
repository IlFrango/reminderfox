		updates if required        Thank to Peter Wills's request

		to a reminder with date of or near to deleted instance

	Context menu item for Add/Subscribe was not switchable with FX

	Status-/AddonBar to run ONLY the very first time after an install
		(in reminderfox.core.loadDefaultPreferences), 
		as  we don't want to override user's addon-bar visibility state once 
		they set it  (this was a complaint of several vocal users)

Updates 2014-02-04 ___ version 2.1.4 (release) _________________________________
	Foxy Icon with Badge now  can be placed to any bar.

		Options --> FX/TB or disabled

Updates 2014-02-02 ___ version 2.1.4 (release) _________________________________
	FoxyBadge on MainMenu and Bow on statusbar didn't followed

		(also some others similar)
	NOTE:  Firefox 26 will work with Bow on statusbar. 
	       Newer FX version (eg. FX29) will NOT support the Addon-Bar, so this 
	       current version of Reminderfox can not show the Bow!
