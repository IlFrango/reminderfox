Improved workflow for upcoming Firefox "Australis" UI. 

The Foxy toolbar icon is the main access interface for ReminderFox.  
From the Options -> Access tab, you can choose to display the number of events for today, as well as display the text of today's reminders.  
For those that prefer the original 'ribbon-icon' rather than the Foxy icon, you can choose that instead. Right-click on the menu and choose Customize... and drag the Ribbon icon and use that instead.

Improvements:
* Styling and UI tweaks.  
* Options pages - Minor updates to wording and styling to make some options clearer.
* Remote calendar performance improvements - compares remote calendar status with local and only updates if needed.
* Remote calendar errors now display error details to the user.
* Added address autocomplete when adding an invitation in Thunnderbird.  (Thanks to contributor Onno Ekker!)

Fixes:
* Fixed: Subscribe with Reminderfox web page context menu action was not working.
* Fixed: Add/Import as New Calendar - was not working.
* From the edit reminder dialog, the Launch Url and Launch Location now open two distinct tabs instead of reusing a single tab.
* Fixes: No longer store timezone information from remote calendars; could cause the ICS file to drastically increase in size.
* Fixed: Foxy toolbar icon and ribbon status icon were not being remembered across restarts (would be hidden upon restart)
* Fixed: When editing a reminder from the alarm dialog, no longer opens the Reminder list window as well.
* Fixed: There was an issue where some invalid ToDo's (that has an invalid empty date) could cause ReminderFox to crash.
* Fixed: Adding a reminder via the web page context menu was not including the page URL 
* Fixed: Foxy toolbar icon and Bow status icon now work properly with Seamonkey
